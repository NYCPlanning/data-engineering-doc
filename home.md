## About us {docsify-ignore}
Data Engineering is a team of technologists within the NYC Department of City Planningâ€™s Enterprise Data Management (EDM) group. We are passionate about data, and everything associated with it, from how itâ€™s created and documented to how itâ€™s shared and used. We believe that data are foundational and weâ€™re excited to bring data to the forefront at NYC Planning.

## Our mission {docsify-ignore}
As data engineers we develop data products. Weâ€™re responsible for creating new databases and modernizing the creation of existing datasets, such as NYCâ€™s definitive tax lot dataset (aka PLUTO), for NYC Planning. The data we produce are used by planners and civic technologists alike in analyses, which help inform decisions that ultimately shape NYC. Our data products also power downstream applications, such as NYCâ€™s Zoning and Land Use Map, used by planners, policy makers, and the public. Therefore, itâ€™s imperative that we publish data and supporting documentation of the highest quality.
